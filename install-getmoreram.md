- Select [this link](https://github.com/hugeBlack/GetMoreRam/releases/download/nightly/Entitlement.ipa) to download GetMoreRAM (appears as "Entitlement.ipa" in Files). This application increases the memory limit on sideloaded apps imposed by iOS. It can boost performace for apps such as DolphiniOS, and is required for apps such as MeloNX and Amethyst.
- Install GetMoreRAM to LiveContainer and run it.
- In GetMoreRAM Settings, select "Sign in". Use your Apple Account credentials to log in. If the app crashes, just try again.
- In GetMoreRAM, navigate to "App IDs" and select "Refresh".
- Select anything including "livecontainer" or "liveprocess", and select "Add Increased Memory Limit". If a bunch of text appears underneath with no mention of an error, you did it correctly.
- Navigate back to SideStore or LiveContainer+SideStore and reinstall LiveContainer as if you are updating it so the new Entitlement takes effect. (Note: If your LiveContainer expires \[you go 7 days without refreshing] you will need to repeat this whole process).

Next:
Navigate to StikDebug's Settings page and scroll to the bottom. Is "TXM" or "Non-TXM" displayed:
- [TXM](./setup-txm.md)
- [Non-TXM](./finished.md)
