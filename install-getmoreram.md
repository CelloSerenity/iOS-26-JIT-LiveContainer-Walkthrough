- Open [this link](https://github.com/hugeBlack/GetMoreRam/releases/download/nightly/Entitlement.ipa) to download Get More Ram (appears as `Entitlement.ipa` in Files). This application increases the memory limit on sideloaded apps imposed by iOS. It can boost performace for apps such as DolphiniOS, and is required for apps such as MeloNX and Amethyst.
- Install Get More Ram to LiveContainer and run it.
- In Settings, select "Sign in". Use your Apple Account credentials to log in. If the app crashes, just try again.
- In navigate to "App IDs" and select "Refresh".
- Select anything including "livecontainer" or "liveprocess", and select "Add Increased Memory Limit". If a bunch of text appears underneath with no mention of an error, you did it correctly.
- Navigate back to SideStore or LiveContainer+SideStore, and reinstall LiveContainer as if you are updating it (so the new entitlement takes effect). (Note: If your LiveContainer expires \[you go 7 days without refreshing] you will need to repeat this whole process).

Next:
Navigate to StikDebug's Settings page and scroll to the bottom. Is "TXM" or "Non-TXM" displayed:
- [TXM](./setup-txm.md)
- [Non-TXM](./finished.md)
