> [!NOTE]
> Safari in iOS/iPadiOS has a bug that sometimes prevents it from automatically downloading `.js` files. If your script doesn't automatically appear in Files → Downloads, follow these steps: Download the script as normal, select the "Downloads" icon (it looks like an arrow inside a circle pointing down, if it doesn't appear, switch to a different tab and it should repopulate), select the script file, select the "Share" icon, select "Save to Files", and save the script to "Downloads".
2. In LiveContainer, double-tap your app that requires JIT.
3. Under "Run with JIT", import the app-specific script you downloaded.
